# CanvaSketcher

CanvaSketcher is a WIP Typescript library used for visualizing data in an interactive and responsive way. By the means of DOM manipulation, any object from an array can be associated to an HTML element, injected into a web page and customized. The newly injected elements can be interacted with via mouse events, allowing functionalities such as: dragging, zooming towards an element, enhancing the element to the center and expanding its content.
